            "It\u2019s a shame that even when after 13 years purchased much Uniqlo pieces I realized all the underwear I bought were the panties were perfect and they don\u2019t sell anymore and not even one expensive bra or bra tops fitted. The is was literally the very last one just a shame because as Uniqlo and the crazy\u2019s return policies online I had such horrible experience that never have even tried to return anything else wasting the money and feeling bad until stop going to Uniqlo completely since they seem to be doing an effort to get rid of brand loyalty retiring any of their items you might like.",
            "Love these bra top, dressed up or down, for all seasons. I have been purchasing the cotton ones for a few years, however recently only Airism ones are available. The Airism material isn\u2019t as comfortable as cotton, especially for a fitted tank. Please bring back cotton bra tank options.",
            "I ordered 3 in same size and color as the prior style, thinking I would love the improved styling. I wore the new style for 4 weeks through multiple washes and discovered why I was always pulling down on the bra top. The support is no longer there! I wanted to like the no elastic band in the back, but that is precisely what I loved about the original style. Sorry this was a disappointment."

            "I really like Unqlo's airism panties! Over the years I have enjoyed the basic panty in LARGE (Note: I normally wear a SMALL but learned the sizing difference with my very first order!). The basic panties are great, decided to try the hip hugger style but I think the basics are best for a \"mature\" woman! Please try the basic style if you haven't before, just purchase two sizes larger than normal."

            "Beautiful item, great material and design. Please keep making this as a staple just like the Airism bra camis but for dressier low cut. I got both the plunging cami and slip, they fit me like a glove with pushup. For reference I am 32A slim and the XS is the right size, tight getting on and off but once it\u2019s on everything fits as it should. Great for that comfortable extra layer, the Airism material keeps me cool and warm at the same time. Material and design is gorgeous. However don\u2019t like Uniqlo\u2019s return policy that we cannot bring items to return at local store and I think they said no returns on undergarments even with tags? This will effect my future purchasing greatly because items like these are not available at my local store to try on. Luckily everything fit me this time, but I don\u2019t think I will order online in the future.",
            "This is EXACTLY what I was looking for. Bought the brown (would've preferred a peach color) in Medium. The length would be better 1/2 inch shorter; the bra fits perfectly\u2014but the band portion is really tight. I'm hoping it eases up with washing and wearing. The slip part is so ultra-clingy that it only offers opacity, zero smoothing."

            "I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and design of this item. I bought the XS and fits me like a glove, no gaps and provides pushup as well. For reference I am 32A and while it is a bit tight getting on and off, once it is on it feels good, not too constrained. I usually wear Uniqlo bra camis and those are super comfy but this is second best for any low cut tops and a dressier undergarment. I also got the slip which keeps me warmer in dresses indoors with AC, yet cool when it\u2019s hot outside because of the Airism material. Beautiful item and the color is a good color underneath. For the reviewer that commented about the stain, if you spot clean, it does leave a terrible water stain. But once washed, it was like new. I would buy more but did not realize Uniqlo changed their policy about returning in-store, and not sure how they regard this item even with tags as undergarment that cannot be returned. I lucked out everything I ordered fit but I hesitate ordering anything else now.",
            "It fits great. I don\u2019t like to feel squeezed in. I also need adjustable straps and they\u2019re very secure despite being silky. It\u2019s well made. Will buy more colors.",
            "This bra top is better suited for B cup. For a 32AA-A there was gapping and shifting. A bummer as this felt really comfortable and the \"34 brown\" color was a perfect nude shade for underneath white clothes for tan skin."

AIRism comes in different weights and textures, but this is like a whisper and so wonderful in the heat and insufferable humidity of our summers. Because I got it for breathability, I didn't want it to fit too tight. So I was happy that the fit wasn't as snug as the AIRism camisole in the same size. I wore it under a top all day outdoors, and it was an airy treat. It will feel comfortably elegant whatever it's put under."

This collaboration includes a special photo T-shirt collection featuring a selection of his early signature photos that capture the mystical beauty of everyday life from unique angles, juxtaposed with some of his quotes.Saul LeiterSaul Leiter is a legendary photographer who spent most of his life in New York City. His work appeared in well-known fashion magazines in the 1950s and 1960s, but he stepped away from the front line in the 1980s. His photo collection Early Color was released in 2006, when he was 82 years old, and was a major hit as he rose to prominence as a pioneer of color photography. Retrospectives and publications featuring Saul Leiter continue to be presented around the world, and a documentary film was released in 2013. Saul Leiter passed away in 2013. Iconic works from his vast collection of approximately 80,000 photographs have been carefully selected for his first apparel collaboration in the world, with UT.Taxi, 1957\u00a9Saul Leiter Foundation"

It's ridiculous - black t-shirts are already hot enough under the sun and walking around in this t-shirt feels like somebody pressed a warm towel on my chest. Even sitting still in a room is rather uncomfortable because of this huge slab of vinyl. Even though the fabric feels soft and good quality, the vinyl pattern is horrible. I'll be peeling it off."

I normally buy L, XL men for 42 inch armpit but this time had to exchange to S or M. Better to buy in store than online because measurements are completely different from other UT t-shirts."

I normally buy L or XL women for 42 inch armpit but this time had to exchange to M. This one says Women but this Snoopy collection Men and Women size is exactly the same vs. previous Womens ones were smaller than Mens from same collection. Better to buy in store than online because sizing is completely different from previous UT collections."

This is quite a versatile article that I recommend for anyone needing less articles in their wardrobe that can be used in multiple situations."

My only problem with it is it's really hard to roll the sleeve up to make it half-sleeve or even 3/4 sleeves. I have short arms so it's a full long-sleeve shirt on me. I still like it though. It's just hard to roll or fold it up. It keeps on getting undone. My solution was to use rubber bands but surely there's an easier way to do it? Maybe if there's a band inside the sleeve that you can button to make it easier? I don't know.",
            "Nice material. White is not see through with a nude bra underneath. Easy shape that is on the boxy side but not oversized. You can either tuck or untuck. Good for hot weather. Size is ok the looser side. I have a medium chest and around size 6 and purchased size S. It is still loose which is how I like my shirts to fir.",
            "The material feels great but if you\u2019re 5 ft 2 in and around 130-149 lbs than do yourself the favor and get a Small instead of a Medium."

            "Perfect for the summer months and super chic. This top is a great pairing for jeans, skirt, shorts, whatever. An upgrade to your usual summer top.",
            "This top is vibrant, lightweight, comfortable, and adorable. I found that it was true to size--I'm on the busty side and wear either size medium or large (US 8-10), but medium worked for me. While it's a purposely flowy top, I wouldn't size down more because then the pleats wouldn't lay correctly. My only complaint is that I wish the pattern matched at the seams, especially for a collaboration with a brand like Marni! In my experience, Uniqlo is usually pretty good about patterns matching at the seams, so this was a bit of a disappointment.",
            "Not like anything I have in my closet. It fits well because it runs large. Wonderful style."

            "I love the color and the material but it was just too big for me. I think the style was already loose fit but UNIQLO suggested I order XL so I did. But it was too loose on me. Looked like I was wearing a sack. Maybe I just have really short arms but these were more of a 3/4 sleeve on me.",

I got it in white and tried it on with a black bra. I can somewhat see the bra through it, but it's definitely not see-through. I could wear the black bra under it in public.",
            "In reference to the review before this, I actually think this tank works great with having a larger chest (I'm 32F to be specific). The L fits, looks, and feels great. This is cropped, of course, but I would not say *too* cropped at all.... Honestly my new favorite tank, I came on here to buy another in white but I had to respond to the other review so that others wouldn't be dissuaded. It's a great tank!!!",

            "The body of the shirt fits me like a glove due to the elastic nature of the shirred material. However, I am not a huge fan of a few things: 1) I don't favor the cropped length, only because I would personally like to wear it with mid-rise pants without showing my stomach. 2) I don't like the feeling of how the material bunches up in the armpit area. It feels like it will probably harbor a lot of sweat and deodorant stains throughout the day. 3) My least favorite thing is the adjustable straps. Even on the shortest setting, the straps still somehow slip and fall if the shirt isn't positioned a certain way. This brings a lot of my focus back to the shirt as I wear it and it is very distracting which makes it uncomfortable to wear."

I like that the buttons help break up the bust line. I'm 32 DDD and the Small fit really nicely under the arms and it is very comfortable -- a surprise! So I got several colors. I noticed more uniqlo crop tops but did not try them because it is so much work to order and return. This one is just fine.",

I always buy a size small in Uniqlo clothes so just keep that in mind if you're ordering online. Otherwise, it's great!"

The black is still in perfect condition, but the purple's threading started to fall apart already somehow. I've only had it for two months. I panicked and luckily there was still more in stock so I bought another."

I did wore it over a dress when trying it on, it was pretty tight on me but I could breathe in it. When I got home, it fit beautifully. I bought it in black and light blue because they all fit me. I couldn't get the white one because they were all out of my size. Overall, this is a nice skirt and I can't wait to pair so many cute tops over it!",

I was afraid it was going to be a little tight on me because my abdomen isn't the most toned out there. But even with a little pudge, it fit nice on me. I like to wear it on my waist, preferably because it makes me look a little taller. Overall, it is a nice skirt. I did bought the other colors (except white b/cuz not in stock) because I needed some staple pieces for my wardrobe.",
            "I went to the store in person and this caught my eye. The skirt is very well-made and great material. I like that the style is versatile for many outfits and the length is long enough for my long torso. It's ends about 2 inches below my fingertips. It runs a full size large though, especially if you want to wear it at your natural waist instead of lower on the hips. My waist is 28-29\" but the small is a perfect fit. Medium, the recommended size, was extremely loose."

They also came with an \"alteration\" stamp on the label, so I'm curious if I was sent someone else's returned tailored pants. They really don't fit in the crotch either, it was a struggle to get them up. I wouldn't buy these again, but need pants for now, I would not recommend them to anyone else.",

            "After almost a decade of the Ultra Stretch Jeans being my go-to, I bought two pairs online during the pandemic (2021), one Heattech the other regular High Rise Ultra Stretch. I bought them two sizes larger to offset the higher rise when compared my current pairs. Strangely, Heattech pair fit correctly the non heat tech insulated pair was too tight... I noticed that the mid-rise were on sale, but they were sold out of my size. Now high rise Ultra Stretch is all that is available. Please bring back the old cut/design/material-- whatever was changed, isn't working. I either have to try a different cut or find another place to get my jeans. So disappointed.",

            "These used to be my favorite jeans. Not sure what happened to the fit/cut/material but the new product is really bad."

            "Classic cut . This is for all seasons: the fabric is neither too thick nor thin . I went one size smaller (23) than suggested since I\u2019m petite (5ft) and the roomy hips and thighs style would overwhelm. Also the fabric has no stretch so go with the Uniqlo suggestion. White is somewhat stiff even after washing.",
            "It is unbelievably too long for a size 23. Never buy online. The size is just not right plus the return is not free if it does not fit.",
            "I\u2019m usually a 26 waist in jeans but I had to buy my second pair in a 24 for a perfect fit (I got the first pair tailored because I couldn\u2019t return them). But the denim quality is pretty decent, they\u2019re a good pair or everyday jeans; no frills (go with everything/easy wardrobe staple) and the denim is good quality for the price, not too stretchy or flimsy. I bought these in white and in blue/medium wash, the white denim is stiffer while the blue has a more soft, lived in kind of feel. I like them both. I also have long legs but these jeans are the perfect length, I often have an issue where my pants are shorter than I\u2019d like."

I wear them for comfort and warmth inside the house and on walks so I don't mind too much, but i wish they keep the style and sizing consistent."

However, the size proved to be absolutely perfect and fit me exactly how I wanted it! Words can\u2019t describe how much I love this shirt, especially with how crisp and clean the designs are plus the fabric feels comfortable. 100% would recommend for any FF fans out there :)",
            "Uniqlo shirts always have such great quality and they're very comfortable, so I am always pleased when I ordered them. Shipping was pretty quick, but the only thing I am little disappointed about is that they said if you order more than 2 shirts you could get the FF cards in your order and I ordered 2 shirts real quick as soon as they were available to order, so I just assume I would be one of the lucky ones to receive those cards in my order. Sadly, I did not, but I still don't regret my purchase and very happy that I got them.",

I ordered M and with my build, I do like a little bit of room in my clothing and when I first tried it on, it did just that. I think it did shrink in the wash (could be my mind if it did or not) but the print remained unaffected and the material did not stain or change how it felt.",
            "It fit very well. I usually go for medium in shirts, but it recommended small. I\u2019m glad I listened. It is slightly more fitted than what I normally buy, but it was a plus. It was still loose while not being baggy. It is also great quality and washed well. I air dried to be safe but it probably could be dried.",

These pants run big I can go down to my regular size XL with a nice loose fit and not too tight. I will rerun and buy my size. I wish returns were free but the pants at Uniqlo are the only brand that fits perfect so i continue to shop here. Great quality. For summer, light weight and adjustable waist string .

            "I had these pants in a size small from several years ago and they were really big around the waist. They were almost falling down. I usually wear a small in pants but I wanted to try the XS. When I first tried on the XS the elastic in the back seemed tight but I wore them all day and they were perfectly comfortable. They look dressy and nice enough for work. The fabric is softer and silkier than my older pair. The elastic around the hem goes all the way around. On my old pair the front hem was smooth and the elastic was only in the back. The length is fine even though I am short. Not sure what they would be like on someone tall. I bought all three colors - navy blue, black and beige. I would probably buy more colors if available. These are great summer pants for work.",

            "I bought a pair of leggings 2 years ago, same style, but without pockets. They are slowly falling apart, so I decided to get a new pair, assuming they will fit the same. Sadly, they don't. :( Compared to the previous model the waist is really stiff/tight, rolling down and overall they seem smaller, even though they are the same size. The material is the same, which I like. I have a white haired dog and that material is a life saver - nothing sticks and it's easy to remove. Like other mentioned, I do miss the option to get leggings without pockets. I hope you'll bring them back one day.",
            "Bought two pairs of these leggings for full price and at first I was super excited about them but after 2 washes, I\u2019ve noticed that the stitching is starting to become undone on both pairs. Keep in mind, I wash these inside laundry bags in the gentle cycle. I also wanted to mention that they do have a tendency to lose its shape and I have to pull them back to my waist, which defeats the purpose of wearing leggings. Overall, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re worth the full price.",
            "The pants fit well and feel great. The only problem is that the waist wide band sometimes folds. This is my second pair, so despite the folding I love the pants."

            "These pants are amazing. The front pockets don\u2019t work which is too bad, but I still have to give them 5 stars because I wear them all the time. I bought these in the cropped and heat tech versions as well, but the hw ones are my go-to because they are so flattering and comfortable. They are a fantastic basic. You can bend over without fear they\u2019ll become see through and the stretch makes them easy and comfortable."

            "Quality wise it was a good purchase, but I thought it was a bit small for me. I usually wear S and I bought size S. I am 164cm 64kg / 5'4.5'' 140lb Hope this helps!",
            "These shorts fit me so well! the pockets are spacious and the shorts have a sporty feel. The shorts let the air circulate well so you can definitely wear this during the spring/summer. It's spacious and doesn't stick to you. It also looks really nice since it's pleated."

            "This balloon skirt has a bit of weight, partly from the gathering and the lining. I'd have preferred a lighter weight cotton lining instead of polyester. But it's airy as the construction tends to push the skirt away from the body. Gathered at the waist, which adds a more bulk there (not visible in the photos with models as they're wearing a long T), but the diagonal gathers keep the bulk down a bit and make it drape nicely. The skirt on me is just below the knees,perfect for this style. The 69 navy color indoors is a lovely indigo, in outdoor sunlight has a bit of a purplish cast to it. I wanted the splashier red & white version but it was out of stock so ordered navy skirt to try the fit (I sized down one). The pockets are deep enough to securely hold a change purse,keys, smart phone. In this color, it's a unique alternative to jeans. Looks good with a shorter T shirt or fitted tops to show more detail. 3 seasons wear for me. I'll keep it! Would love it in fluid silk!"
